# Practical introduction to Julia for modelling and data analysis in biodiversity and earth sciences

This repository contains materials for the [WSL Julia Workshop 2023](https://www.wsl.ch/de/ueber-die-wsl/die-wsl-im-dialog/details/practical-introduction-to-julia-for-modelling-and-data-analysis-in-biodiversity-and-earth-sciences.html) **Practical introduction to Julia for modelling and data analysis in biodiversity and earth sciences**, held on the 24th and 27th of March 2023 at WSL Birmensdorf. 

# Content

The repository is organized by days and sessions. Please refer to the [Program](#program) to navigate within the repo.

# Requirements

To follow the workshop materials, you need to have the following software installed on your computer:
- Julia 
- Jupyter

Additionally, we recommend to use 
- VSCode

as an IDE, together with the Julia extension.

Please refer to the [installation instructions](Misc/installation_instructions.md) for further information on how to proceed.


# Usage

To use the workshop materials, clone this repository to your local machine:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/[username]/[repository-name].git
```
Then, navigate to the cloned repository and start a Julia session. You can run the examples and exercises in the notebooks by opening them in Jupyter or Pluto:


```julia
using IJulia # if you installed Jupyter notebooks
notebook(dir="notebooks/")
```

### Coffee break

### Morning session 2
- Interface with Python, R, matlab (30 min)

- **Talk** Track Introductions
  - Biodiversity track
  - Glaciology track
### Lunch

### Afternoon session 1



### Coffee break

### Afternoon session 2
- **Q&A**
- Participants will share their progress and discuss their experience working on the project.


# Projects
## Biodiversity track

### Project 1
