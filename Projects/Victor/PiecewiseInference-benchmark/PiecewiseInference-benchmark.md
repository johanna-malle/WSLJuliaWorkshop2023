# Hyper parameter optimization of a machine learning-based SDM

## Project description and objectives

#### Project Objectives
The goal of the project is to compare the performance of PiecewiseInference.jl against the two popular libraries, ApproxBayes.jl and Turing.jl, in fitting a 3-species ecosystem model using time-series data. The benchmark will help evaluate the strengths and weaknesse

#### Methodology


## Useful information

- [A cool Julia tutorial on approximate Bayesian computation with ApproxBayes.jl](https://vboussange.github.io/post/abc_inference/). Can be used as a basis for using xxx
- [A cool Julia tutorial on Bayesian inference with Turing.jl](https://turinglang.org/v0.24/tutorials/10-bayesian-differential-equations/).

### How to choose neural network architecture

## Getting started

### Data cleaning

### Some useful chunks of code

#### MLP function generator

## Grid search

## Hyperparameter optimization

## Going further

Can you spot differences in architectures when trying to predict species communities?
