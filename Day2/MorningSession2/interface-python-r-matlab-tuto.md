# Julia Interface with Python, R, and MATLAB

In this tutorial, we will learn how to use Julia's built-in packages to interface with other programming languages such as Python, R, and MATLAB. This will allow you to leverage the strengths of these programming languages while still working within the Julia environment.
## Python
### PyCall.jl

PyCall is a package that allows you to call Python functions from within Julia. Here are the steps to use it:
1. Open a new Julia session and install the PyCall package:

```julia
using Pkg
Pkg.add("PyCall")
```


1. Once PyCall is installed, you can call Python functions in the following way:

```julia
using PyCall
np = pyimport("numpy")
a = np.array([1,2,3])
```



In this example, we import the NumPy library and use it to create a new NumPy array.
### PyPlot.jl

PyPlot is a package that allows you to create plots in Julia using the Matplotlib library in Python. Here are the steps to use it:
1. Install the PyPlot package:

```julia
using Pkg
Pkg.add("PyPlot")
```


1. Once PyPlot is installed, you can create a plot using the following code:

```julia
using PyPlot
x = linspace(0, 2*pi, 1000)
y = sin.(3*x + 4*cos.(2*x))
plot(x, y, color="red", linewidth=2.0, linestyle="--")
```



In this example, we create a sine wave using Julia's built-in `linspace` and `sin` functions, and then plot the data using PyPlot.
## R
### RCall.jl

RCall is a package that allows you to call R functions from within Julia. Here are the steps to use it:
1. Open a new Julia session and install the RCall package:

```julia
using Pkg
Pkg.add("RCall")
```


1. Once RCall is installed, you can call R functions in the following way:

```julia
using RCall
R"""
library(ggplot2)
data(mtcars)
p <- ggplot(mtcars, aes(x=wt, y=mpg)) + geom_point()
print(p)
"""
```



In this example, we load the ggplot2 library in R and use it to create a scatter plot of the "mtcars" dataset.
## MATLAB
### MATLAB.jl

MATLAB.jl is a package that allows you to call MATLAB functions from within Julia. Here are the steps to use it:
1. Open a new Julia session and install the MATLAB.jl package:

```julia
using Pkg
Pkg.add("MATLAB")
```


1. Once MATLAB.jl is installed, you can call MATLAB functions in the following way:

```julia
using MATLAB
x = linspace(0, 2*pi, 1000)
y = call(:sin, x)
```



In this example, we create a sine wave using MATLAB's built-in `sin` function and then plot the data using Julia's built-in `linspace` and `plot` functions.

In this tutorial, we learned how to use Julia's built-in packages to interface with other programming languages such as Python, R, and MATLAB. This will allow you to leverage the strengths of these programming languages while still working within the Julia environment.
