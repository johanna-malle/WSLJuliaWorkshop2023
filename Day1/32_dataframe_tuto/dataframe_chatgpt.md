Person: 
- You are a teacher who is teaching participants to a Julia workshop how to use dataframes, how to perform broadcasting, and how to perform data visualisation. Pease write a complete exercise, together with the solutions. Participants must use a reasonably large dataframe as a basis for the exercise. This dataframe could be obtained from a CSV file obtained from the GBIF dataset. You may ask for some data analysis of this dataframe.

ChatGPT: 
- Exercise: Analyzing GBIF dataset using DataFrames, Broadcasting, and Data Visualization

In this exercise, we will use the GBIF dataset, which contains information about occurrences of species recorded by the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF). We will load this dataset into a DataFrame, perform some data analysis, use broadcasting to modify the DataFrame, and create some visualizations to represent the data.

Step 1: Load the GBIF dataset

The first step is to download the GBIF dataset from the GBIF website, or use a pre-existing CSV file containing the data. In this exercise, we will assume that the data is already in a file called 'gbif_data.csv'.

To load the dataset into a DataFrame, we will use the `CSV.jl` package. Make sure that this package is installed before proceeding.

```julia
using CSV, DataFrames

# Load the dataset into a DataFrame
df = CSV.read("gbif_data.csv", DataFrame)
```



Step 2: Data Analysis

Now that we have loaded the dataset into a DataFrame, let's perform some data analysis. For this exercise, we will focus on the following columns: 
- `species`: The name of the species 
- `year`: The year in which the observation was made 
- `country`: The country in which the observation was made 
- `lat`: The latitude of the observation 
- `lon`: The longitude of the observation

We will start by getting some basic information about the DataFrame.

```julia
# Get the number of rows and columns in the DataFrame
println("The DataFrame has $(size(df, 1)) rows and $(size(df, 2)) columns.")

# Get the first 5 rows of the DataFrame
println("\nThe first 5 rows of the DataFrame are:")
println(first(df, 5))

# Get the summary statistics for the `year`, `lat`, and `lon` columns
println("\nSummary statistics for the `year`, `lat`, and `lon` columns:")
println(describe(df[[:year, :lat, :lon]])))
```



Step 3: Broadcasting

Next, we will use broadcasting to modify the DataFrame. We will create a new column called `decade` that contains the decade in which the observation was made.

```julia
# Create a new column called `decade` that contains the decade in which the observation was made
df[!, :decade] = floor.(Int, df.year ./ 10) .* 10

# Print the first 5 rows of the DataFrame to check that the new column was added correctly
println("\nThe first 5 rows of the DataFrame with the `decade` column added are:")
println(first(df, 5))
```



Step 4: Data Visualization

Finally, we will create some visualizations to represent the data. We will create a scatter plot that shows the latitude and longitude of the observations, with each point colored according to the decade in which the observation was made.

```julia
using Plots

# Create a scatter plot that shows the latitude and longitude of the observations,
# with each point colored according to the decade in which the observation was made
scatter(df.lat, df.lon, color = df.decade, legend = false,
        xlabel = "Latitude", ylabel = "Longitude", title = "GBIF dataset",
        markersize = 3, markerstrokewidth = 0)
```



Solutions:

After running the code, you should see the following output:

```sql
The DataFrame has 10000 rows and 14 columns.

The first 5 rows of the DataFrame are:
  gbifid    datasetkey                         occurrenceid  ... identified_by       date_identified  license
────────
```

Person: 
- Include an exercise where students use the function `groupby`

ChatGPT: 
- Exercise: Grouping and Aggregating Data in the GBIF Dataset using `groupby`

In this exercise, we will use the GBIF dataset to group and aggregate data using the `groupby` function. We will group the data by country and decade, and then calculate the total number of observations for each group.

Step 1: Load the GBIF dataset

We will start by loading the GBIF dataset into a DataFrame. We assume that the data is already in a file called 'gbif_data.csv'.

```julia
using CSV, DataFrames

# Load the dataset into a DataFrame
df = CSV.read("gbif_data.csv", DataFrame)
```



Step 2: Data Analysis

Now that we have loaded the dataset into a DataFrame, let's perform some data analysis. For this exercise, we will focus on the following columns: 
- `species`: The name of the species 
- `year`: The year in which the observation was made 
- `country`: The country in which the observation was made 
- `lat`: The latitude of the observation 
- `lon`: The longitude of the observation

We will start by getting some basic information about the DataFrame.

```julia
# Get the number of rows and columns in the DataFrame
println("The DataFrame has $(size(df, 1)) rows and $(size(df, 2)) columns.")

# Get the first 5 rows of the DataFrame
println("\nThe first 5 rows of the DataFrame are:")
println(first(df, 5))

# Get the summary statistics for the `year`, `lat`, and `lon` columns
println("\nSummary statistics for the `year`, `lat`, and `lon` columns:")
println(describe(df[[:year, :lat, :lon]])))
```



Step 3: Grouping and Aggregating Data

Next, we will use the `groupby` function to group the data by country and decade, and then calculate the total number of observations for each group.

```julia
# Group the data by country and decade, and then calculate the total number of observations for each group
df_grouped = groupby(df, [:country, :decade])
df_aggregated = aggregate(df_grouped, :species => length)
```



Step 4: Data Visualization

Finally, we will create a bar chart that shows the total number of observations for each country and decade.

```julia
using Plots

# Create a bar chart that shows the total number of observations for each country and decade
bar(df_aggregated.country, df_aggregated.length_species, group = df_aggregated.decade,
    xlabel = "Country", ylabel = "Number of observations", title = "GBIF dataset",
    legend = :top, xrotation = 90)
```



Solutions:

After running the code, you should see a bar chart that shows the total number of observations for each country and decade. The bars should be grouped by decade and labeled with the decade values.

Person: 
- Add a step where students are asked to perform some regression analysis

ChatGPT: 
- Exercise: Grouping, Aggregating, and Regression Analysis in the GBIF Dataset

In this exercise, we will use the GBIF dataset to perform grouping and aggregating operations, and then perform a regression analysis to explore the relationship between two variables. We will group the data by country and decade, calculate the total number of observations for each group, and then perform a regression analysis to explore the relationship between the number of observations and latitude.

Step 1: Load the GBIF dataset

We will start by loading the GBIF dataset into a DataFrame. We assume that the data is already in a file called 'gbif_data.csv'.

```julia
using CSV, DataFrames

# Load the dataset into a DataFrame
df = CSV.read("gbif_data.csv", DataFrame)
```



Step 2: Data Analysis

Now that we have loaded the dataset into a DataFrame, let's perform some data analysis. For this exercise, we will focus on the following columns: 
- `year`: The year in which the observation was made 
- `country`: The country in which the observation was made 
- `lat`: The latitude of the observation 
- `lon`: The longitude of the observation

We will start by getting some basic information about the DataFrame.

```julia
# Get the number of rows and columns in the DataFrame
println("The DataFrame has $(size(df, 1)) rows and $(size(df, 2)) columns.")

# Get the first 5 rows of the DataFrame
println("\nThe first 5 rows of the DataFrame are:")
println(first(df, 5))

# Get the summary statistics for the `year`, `lat`, and `lon` columns
println("\nSummary statistics for the `year`, `lat`, and `lon` columns:")
println(describe(df[[:year, :lat, :lon]])))
```



Step 3: Grouping and Aggregating Data

Next, we will use the `groupby` function to group the data by country and decade, and then calculate the total number of observations for each group.

```julia
# Group the data by country and decade, and then calculate the total number of observations for each group
df_grouped = groupby(df, [:country, :decade])
df_aggregated = aggregate(df_grouped, :year => length)
```



Step 4: Regression Analysis

Finally, we will perform a regression analysis to explore the relationship between the number of observations and latitude. We will use the `lm` function from the `StatsModels` package to perform the regression analysis.

```julia
using StatsModels

# Perform a regression analysis to explore the relationship between the number of observations and latitude
model = lm(@formula(length_year ~ lat), df_aggregated)
println("\nThe regression results are:")
println(model)

# Plot the regression line and the scatter plot of the data
scatter(df_aggregated.lat, df_aggregated.length_year, xlabel = "Latitude", ylabel = "Number of observations",
        title = "GBIF dataset", legend = false)
plot!(df_aggregated.lat, predict(model), xlabel = "Latitude", ylabel = "Number of observations",
      label = "Regression line")
```



Solutions:

After running the code, you should see a scatter plot of the data with the regression line. The regression results should be printed to the console. You can interpret the results to determine the relationship between the number of observations and latitude.

Person: 
- Increment the exercise, further asking to the participants some data scrapping.

ChatGPT: 
- Exercise: Data Scrapping, Grouping, Aggregating, and Regression Analysis in the GBIF Dataset

In this exercise, we will start by scraping some data from the GBIF website, and then use this data to perform grouping and aggregating operations, and then perform a regression analysis to explore the relationship between two variables. We will scrape the data for a specific taxon and time range, group the data by country and decade, calculate the total number of observations for each group, and then perform a regression analysis to explore the relationship between the number of observations and latitude.

Step 1: Data Scrapping

We will start by scraping the GBIF website for data on a specific taxon and time range. We will use the `HTTP` and `JSON` packages to make a GET request to the GBIF API, and then parse the response into a DataFrame.

```julia
using HTTP, JSON, DataFrames

# Define the taxon and time range of interest
taxon_key = 2435093 # replace with the taxon key of interest
start_year = 2010
end_year = 2020

# Make a GET request to the GBIF API and parse the response into a DataFrame
response = HTTP.get("https://api.gbif.org/v1/occurrence/search?taxonKey=$(taxon_key)&year=$(start_year),$(end_year)")
json_response = JSON.parse(String(response.body))
df = DataFrame(json_response["results"])
```



Step 2: Data Analysis

Now that we have scraped the data and loaded it into a DataFrame, let's perform some data analysis. For this exercise, we will focus on the following columns: 
- `year`: The year in which the observation was made 
- `country`: The country in which the observation was made 
- `lat`: The latitude of the observation 
- `lon`: The longitude of the observation

We will start by getting some basic information about the DataFrame.

```julia
# Get the number of rows and columns in the DataFrame
println("The DataFrame has $(size(df, 1)) rows and $(size(df, 2)) columns.")

# Get the first 5 rows of the DataFrame
println("\nThe first 5 rows of the DataFrame are:")
println(first(df, 5))

# Get the summary statistics for the `year`, `lat`, and `lon` columns
println("\nSummary statistics for the `year`, `lat`, and `lon` columns:")
println(describe(df[[:year, :lat, :lon]]))
```



Step 3: Grouping and Aggregating Data

Next, we will use the `groupby` function to group the data by country and decade, and then calculate the total number of observations for each group.

```julia
# Add a decade column to the DataFrame
df.decade = df.year .÷ 10 .* 10

# Group the data by country and decade, and then calculate the total number of observations for each group
df_grouped = groupby(df, [:country, :decade])
df_aggregated = aggregate(df_grouped, :year => length)
```



Step 4: Regression Analysis

Finally, we will perform a regression analysis to explore the relationship between the number of observations and latitude. We will use the `lm` function from the `StatsModels` package to perform the regression analysis.

```julia
using StatsModels

# Perform a regression analysis to explore the relationship between the number of observations and latitude
model = lm(@formula(length_year ~ lat), df_aggregated)
println("\nThe regression results are:")
println(model)

# Plot the regression line and the scatter plot of the data
scatter(df_aggregated.lat, df_ag
```

Person: 
- 2 / 2

ChatGPT: 
- Sure! Here is an additional step to save a new DataFrame with some interesting statistics as a CSV file.

Step 5: Save the DataFrame as a CSV file

Finally, we will save the aggregated DataFrame as a CSV file. We will add some interesting new statistics to the DataFrame before saving it as a CSV file.

```julia
# Add some interesting statistics to the DataFrame
df_aggregated.mean_lat = combine(groupby(df, [:country, :decade]), :lat => mean).mean_lat
df_aggregated.mean_lon = combine(groupby(df, [:country, :decade]), :lon => mean).mean_lon
df_aggregated.obs_per_decade = df_aggregated[!, :length_year] ./ 10

# Save the DataFrame as a CSV file
CSV.write("observations_by_country_and_decade.csv", df_aggregated)
```



The code above adds three new columns to the `df_aggregated` DataFrame: 
- `mean_lat`: The mean latitude of the observations for each country and decade group 
- `mean_lon`: The mean longitude of the observations for each country and decade group 
- `obs_per_decade`: The average number of observations per decade for each country group

It then saves the updated `df_aggregated` DataFrame as a CSV file named "observations_by_country_and_decade.csv".
