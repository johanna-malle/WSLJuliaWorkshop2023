    "1. To use `Pkg`, start by typing `]` in the Julia REPL (read-eval-print loop). This will take you to the package manager prompt. \n",
    "2. From the package manager prompt, you can execute a variety of commands. Some of the most commonly used ones include: \n",
    "- `add`: adds a package to the current project \n",
    "- `rm`: removes a package to the current project\n",
    "- `update`: updates all packages in the current project to their latest versions \n",
    "- `activate`: switches to a different project environment \n",
    "- `instantiate`: installs all packages specified in a project's `Project.toml` file \n",
    "1. When you run `add` to install a package, `Pkg` will download and install the package, along with any dependencies it requires.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. To load a package in your code, you can use the `using` keyword followed by the package name. For example, to load the `CSV` package, you would write `using CSV` at the top of your code. \n",
    "\n",
    "3. `Pkg` also allows you to manage different versions of a package across different projects. This is useful to keep project environments reproducible, nice and tidy.\n"
